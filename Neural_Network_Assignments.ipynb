        "   - **When to Use**: Ideal for smooth loss surfaces or when fine-tuning learning rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**\n",
        "   - **Description**: Combines momentum and adaptive learning rates based on the first and second moments of the gradients.\n",

        "#### **Causes:**\n",
        "1. **Saturated Activation Functions**: Functions like **sigmoid** and **tanh** squash their outputs into a small range. When inputs are very large or small, gradients become tiny.\n",
        "   - Example: For **sigmoid**, the derivative is between 0 and 0.25, so gradients diminish as the function saturates.\n",
