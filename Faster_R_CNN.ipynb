        "\n",
        "1. **Backbone Network (Feature Extraction)**:\n",
        "   - A deep CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) extracts feature maps from the input image.\n",
        "   - These feature maps encode both low- and high-level features of the image.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**:\n",
        "   - A fully convolutional network that generates region proposals directly from feature maps.\n",
        "   - It predicts objectness scores (likelihood of containing an object) and bounding box coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Region of Interest (RoI) Pooling**:\n",
        "   - Converts region proposals (from RPN) into fixed-size feature maps.\n",
        "   - Standardizes the varying sizes of proposals for processing in subsequent layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Fully Connected (FC) Layers**:\n",
        "   - Perform classification (object categories) and bounding box regression (refining box locations).\n",
        "   - This step finalizes the detection process by assigning class labels and refining the coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Advantages:\n",
